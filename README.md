# Angel Tribaldos - Software Developer

## Introduction
Hello, everyone! I'm Angel Tribaldos, a passionate software developer with a background in computer science. I have experience working with a variety of technologies and languages, including JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Express, Django, MySQL, and MongoDB. This README file provides an overview of my skills, experience, and projects.

## Skills
- Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, Express.js, Django
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB
- Version Control: Git

## Experience
I have been working in the software development field for several years, gaining practical experience in various projects. Here are some highlights:

- Developed a full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to provide an online marketplace for buying and selling products. This involved designing the database schema, implementing the frontend UI, and building server-side APIs.

- Created a Python-based web scraper using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract data from multiple websites and store it in a MySQL database. The scraper was able to handle dynamic web content and perform regular updates to keep the data up to date.

- Collaborated on a team project to develop a Django-based content management system (CMS) for a publishing company. This involved building custom admin interfaces, integrating with external APIs, and implementing user authentication and authorization.

## Projects
Here are some noteworthy projects I have worked on:

1. **Online Marketplace** - A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack. Users can browse, buy, and sell products, and the application handles secure transactions.

2. **Web Scraper** - A Python-based web scraper that extracts data from websites using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Data is stored in a MySQL database for further analysis.

3. **Content Management System** - A Django-based CMS for managing content, including articles, images, and user permissions. The CMS integrates with external services for content publishing and distribution.
